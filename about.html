    <p class="about">
        I am a former marking manager, current volunteer and humanitarian at heart whose passions include
        education, literacy, disability awareness and the healing power of animals. I have volunteered as a local pet
        therapy
        team for university stress buster events and raised guide dog puppies for a national organization. I have been a caregiver to senior family members. I also spent many
        years volunteering in elementary school room classrooms presenting author studies activities as well as
        helping with reading. In my spare
        time, I enjoy hiking, gardening, learning to make
        bread and spending time with my family.
